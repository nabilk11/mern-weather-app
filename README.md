# MERN Stack Weather Application
This application makes use of the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node) and a free weather API in order to create a Full Stack weather application that provides users their local weather based on the zip code they enter.

The project will also use Redux for state, and axios amongs other tools.

I have added the following dependencies to begin this project.
- axios: HTTP client
- express: web application framework for Node
- mongoose: MongoDB object modeling tool
- body-parser: body parsing middleware
- cors: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware
- dotenv: loads environment variables from a .env file into process.env
- nodemon: automatically restarts node after changes
- concurrently: runs multiple commands concurrently
